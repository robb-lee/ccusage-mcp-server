> **Context Note**: This command triggers the ccusage MCP server to send your token usage data.

## Usage

2. Sends the data to your configured n8n webhook
3. Adds a row to your Google Sheets
4. Shows confirmation with usage summary

## Instructions for Claude
When the user types `/robb:send-usage`, you should:

1. Use the send-usage tool from the ccusage-tracker MCP server to send token usage data
2. The tool will automatically get today's usage and send it
3. Display the response showing what was sent

Example response format:
```
âœ… Usage data sent successfully!

If there's an error, help troubleshoot by checking:

- Is the webhook URL configured correctly?
- Is the n8n workflow active?
